This repository contains a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate with the new App Router paradigm and JWT authentication using a Laravel REST API.

## Nestjs backend

We created a [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) REST API inspired by Nestjs. You can find the
repository [here](https://github.com/bundocba/nestjs-auth-jwt-postgresql-prisma).

## Features

- JWT authentication with [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) (login, register)
- Profile updating
- Password changing
- TypeScript

## Installation

1. `npm install`
2. `cp .env.example .env.local`
3. `npm run dev`

## Authentication

The access token has a TTL of 1 hour until it expires. The access token should be refreshed within this time window to avoid becoming unauthenticated. The access token can be refreshed for two weeks. After that, the user has to log in again.

This behavior can be changed in the [REST API repository](https://github.com/bundocba/nestjs-auth-jwt-postgresql-prisma).
